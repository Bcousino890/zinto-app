-- Migration: Quick Reply Templates System
-- Description: Add quick reply templates functionality for faster message responses
-- Date: 2025-08-03

-- Create quick_reply_templates table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "quick_reply_templates" (
  "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  "company_id" INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES "companies"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  "created_by_id" INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES "users"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE,
  
  -- Template content
  "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "content" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "category" TEXT DEFAULT 'general',
  
  -- Variable tracking
  "variables" JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
  
  -- Template settings
  "is_active" BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  "usage_count" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  "sort_order" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  
  -- Timestamps
  "created_at" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  "updated_at" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "idx_quick_reply_templates_company_id" ON "quick_reply_templates"("company_id");
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "idx_quick_reply_templates_created_by" ON "quick_reply_templates"("created_by_id");
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "idx_quick_reply_templates_category" ON "quick_reply_templates"("category");

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "idx_quick_reply_templates_usage_count" ON "quick_reply_templates"("usage_count");

-- Add compound index for company-scoped queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "idx_quick_reply_templates_company_active" ON "quick_reply_templates"("company_id", "is_active");

-- Add comments for documentation
COMMENT ON TABLE "quick_reply_templates" IS 'Quick reply templates for faster message responses with variable substitution';
COMMENT ON COLUMN "quick_reply_templates"."variables" IS 'Array of variable names used in the template content (e.g., ["contact.name", "date.today"])';
COMMENT ON COLUMN "quick_reply_templates"."content" IS 'Template content with variables in {{variable}} format';
COMMENT ON COLUMN "quick_reply_templates"."category" IS 'Template category for organization (e.g., greeting, follow-up, information)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN "quick_reply_templates"."usage_count" IS 'Number of times this template has been used';
COMMENT ON COLUMN "quick_reply_templates"."sort_order" IS 'Display order for templates within a company';
